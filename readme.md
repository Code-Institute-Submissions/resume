*UX*
The user interface has been designed to be minimalist but exciting with full screen background photos and adaptive font sizes (using vh and vw).

All links  open in a target="_blank" mode (new tab).

This site was tested for mobile devices.

*Technologies*
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

*Features*
This site uses some JavaScript code for the side bar which creates a smooth effect and a very user friendly navigation system.

*Features Left to Implement*
In the future, I would like to make the contact form work as for now this would involve too much back end which is irrelevant for this first section of the training course.
When my new CV is ready I will also add a link to it (pdf document).


*Deployment*
This site has been deployed thanks to GitHub pages.
